# Articles-To-Speech
A web-app which turns an online article into a realistic audio-book(audio-article).

It strips most formatting of the article, and attempts to only select the main text, and uses the Google Text to speech API to generate a mp3 of the main text.

To use, just copy the link of an article you've found, paste it in the front-end searchbox (localhost:3000).

The mp3 will be output in ~/be_analytic_scraper/src/be/html_parser/media.

(You will need to have a Google Cloud Services account to use this).
