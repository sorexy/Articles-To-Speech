# Articles-To-Speech
A web-app which turns an online article into a realistic audio-book(audio-article).

It strips most formatting, and uses the Google Text to speech API to generate the mp3

To use, just copy the link of an article you've found, paste it in the front-end searchbox (localhost:3000)

The mp3 will be output in ~/be_analytic_scraper/src/be/html_parser/media

(You will need to have a Google Cloud Services account to use this)
